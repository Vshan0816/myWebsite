            <h1>Blazblue</h1>
            <p>My introduction to the fighting game scene was Blazblue Calamity Trigger which was released in 2009 and published by Arc System
            Works I played at in Manhattan in the arcade at Chinatown Fair. This was my first fighting game and I was hooked with the gameplay 
            and the artwork from the beginning. I even got to travel to th EVO tournament series in Las Vegas and while I was an awful player, I really enjoyed
            the event</p>
            <p>The characters i played were Ragna and Jin</p>

            <h1>Guilty Gear</h1>
            <p>Guilty Gear was an older frandchise also published by Arc system works, which launched in 1998 but it had a newer version
            called Guilty Gear Xrd, which launched in 2014. In 2020 an older version called Guilty Gear Accent Core Plus R, got a huge netcode
            improvement and i played that as well. Additionally this year on June 11th, a new title called Guilty Gear Strive is launching
            with better graphics, but a simplification of the gameplay.
            </p>
            <p>I played Ky Kiske in Xrd, and I played Millia in Plus R</p>

            <h1>Street Fighter V</h1>
            <p>Street Fighter V launched in 2016, and this was also a game I enjoyed. They got rid of some old system mechanics such as 
            invincible backdashes, crouch teching, and focus attack from street fighter 4. This limited defensive options which made the game 
            a bit more balanced.

            <h1>Valorant</h1>
            <p>Valorant was one of the first shooters on PC that I got really into. I really improved by aim after playing this game with 
            the assistance of the in game training mode in addition to playing Aim Lab on steam. I loved the combination of using abilities 
            added to gunplay. The only downside is that it's a 5v5 team game and it is hard to find friends who work well together.
